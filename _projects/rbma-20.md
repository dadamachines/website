    <h1 class="title is-size-1-desktop">RED BULL – RBMA-20</h1>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3-desktop mt-1">With a length of 10 meters and a height of 2.2 meters, the RBMA-20 is the largest sequencer ever built and it's fully functional. The sequencer features 427 knobs and faders, as well as four analog drummachines, a modular synthesizer and a sampling unit. Designed and built by the Berlin based creative studio NEULANT VAN EXEL, 30 technicians have been working for five weeks to assemble this unique piece of gear.</p>
