We are happy to share that **dadamachines** and [Musical Instrument Designs](https://instrument-design.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} will begin work on the TBD DSP Toolkit project, supported by the NLnet NGI0 Commons Fund.

TBD is an open‑source platform for audio DSP that supports experimentation, learning and instrument design. We look forward to making the platform easier to use for musicians, students and developers.

### What is the TBD DSP Toolkit?

TBD DSP Toolkit is an open‑source platform for audio DSP for experimentation, learning, and audio research. It brings together more than 50 high‑quality generators and effects within a modular, easily extensible architecture. TBD has a flexible approach to embedded audio processing, and aims to deliver an accessible, musician‑friendly environment, both in software and hardware.

A key new component is a standalone desktop version of the hardware with standard MIDI connectivity — designed to welcome users beyond the Eurorack community and make the platform easier to adopt for education, prototyping, and instrument design. This also includes a redesigned, intuitive web user interface and UX guidelines to help developers build playable, musician‑centered DSP modules, plus clear documentation, example use‑cases, and reference workflows.

By uniting developer flexibility with musician usability, TBD aims to offer a resilient, open‑source alternative in a landscape dominated by proprietary platforms. All software is released under GPL 3.0, and updated open hardware designs will be published in KiCad.
